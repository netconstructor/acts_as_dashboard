Description:
    The dashboard generator creates the files and configuration for a "dashboard"
    powered by ActsAsDashboard.

    The generator takes an optional controller name as its argument. The controller
    name may be given in CamelCase or snake_case. It should not be suffixed with
    anything. For example, if the controller is to be named "StatsController",
    specify "Stats" rather than "StatsController".

    If the optional controller name is not provided, it will default to "Dashboard",
    and a controller named DashboardsController will be created.

Example:
    script/generate dashboard

    This will create a "dashboard" named "dashboard" that can be accessed at
    http://localhost:3000/dashboard .

Example:
    script/generate dashboard overview

    This will create a "dashboard" named "overview" that can be accessed at
    http://localhost:3000/overview .
